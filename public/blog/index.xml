      <description>Recent events have forced me to consider what possibilities exist for sustaining the ongoing development of Cosmos in the absence of single company that employs the majority of developers.
Every single credible blockchain project envisions a day when development is more decentralized. In competitive environment, the question of how to actually have a multi-entity set of developers is always left for another day.
In Cosmos I see two realities. One, we already have many contributing teams and entities.</description>

      <description>ZK SNARKs are one of the most amazing products of modern cutting edge cryptography. They let a prover secretly run a program of arbitrary complexity and generate a compact proof that any can verify that correctly ran the program. The program can have secret inputs and the prover reveals nothing to the user.
Zk SNARKs have been deployed in the ZCash cryptocurrency and many other protocols are examining using them. SNARKs represent the culmination of decades of research into the field anonymous credentials.</description>
